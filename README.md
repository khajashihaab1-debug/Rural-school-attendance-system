3. Click "Start Camera" to activate the webcam
4. Position the student in front of the camera
5. Click "Capture Photo" to take their picture
6. Click "Register Student" to save the information

### 2. Mark Attendance

1. Go to "Mark Attendance" section
2. Click "Start Camera" to begin
3. Students should look at the camera (multiple students can be detected)
4. Click "Mark Attendance" to capture and process the image
5. The system will automatically identify and mark present students
6. View the detected students and today's summary

## System Requirements

### Minimum Hardware
- **Processor**: Intel Core i3 or equivalent
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 2GB free space
- **Camera**: Any USB webcam or built-in camera

### Software Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.14+, or Linux
- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher
- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest versions)

## Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with the following main tables:

- **Students**: Store student information and face encodings
- **Attendance**: Record daily attendance with timestamps and confidence scores

## Security Features

- Face encodings are stored securely in the database
- No raw images are stored (only processed encodings)
- Local database ensures data privacy
- No internet connection required for operation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not working**
   - Check browser permissions for camera access
   - Ensure no other applications are using the camera
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Face not detected**
   - Ensure good lighting conditions
   - Student should look directly at the camera
   - Remove glasses or face coverings if possible

3. **Low recognition accuracy**
   - Re-register the student with a clearer photo
   - Ensure consistent lighting during registration and attendance

### Performance Tips

- Use good lighting for better face detection
- Keep the camera at eye level
- Ensure students are 2-3 feet from the camera
- Register students with clear, front-facing photos

## Future Enhancements

- Mobile app for teachers
- Multi-camera support
- Advanced analytics and insights
- Integration with school management systems
- Automated report generation and email delivery

## Support
